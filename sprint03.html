    <p>3. Are there any blockers?</p>

    <br>

    <strong>Monday:</strong>
    <p>2. Continuing to write audio transcripts. </p>
    <p>3. No current blockers.</p>

    <strong>Tuesday:</strong>
    <p>1. Wrapped up the transcripts and interview research analysis. </p>
    <p>2. Finish affinity diagram and divide topics for thematic analysis.</p>
    <p>3. I am beginning to worry about moving forward without a solution plan in mind.</p>

    <strong>Wednesday:</strong>
    <p>1. Completed affinity diagram, thematic analysis and personas. </p>
    <p>2. Today I am to complete the current state user journey and update the status of my kan ban board.</p>
    <p>3. No current blockers.</p>

    <strong>Thursday:</strong>
    <p>1. Finished the final details of personas before moving on to current state user journey.</p>
    <p>2. Keep brainstorming solution ideas and look at case studies that may be relevant.</p>
    <p>3. No current blockers.</p>

    <strong>Friday:</strong>
    <p>1. Got a solution idea to elaborate on through the ideation phase as well as wrapping up the chosen case study analysis. </p>
    <p>2. Now that an idea is present I aim to research potential competitors and analyse their brand in comparison.</p>

    <h3>What went well?</h3>
    <p>During this sprint, I made strong progress in solidifying my research findings, especially through completing audio transcripts and thematic analysis. Breaking these tasks into stages like the affinity diagram and personas helped clarify key insights. By the end of the week, I was able to define a potential solution idea, which gave me a strong sense of direction heading into the ideation phase. This felt like a turning point, which further gave me motivated to move on to the next design phase.</p>

    
    <h3>What didn't go well?</h3>
    <p>Although I stayed productive throughout the week, there was a noticeable period of uncertainty mid sprint. I started to worry about not having a clear solution choice, which added stress and slightly disrupted my momentum. It felt like I was gathering a lot of insights but lacked clarity on how to apply them.</p>

    
    <h3>What can be improved?</h3>
    <p>One thing I’ve learned is that I need to allow space for exploration and further ideation without letting it get in the way of my schedule. It’s okay not to have the full solution upfront, what matters is continuing to work through the unknowns. I also realised the importance of documenting small steps and reflections, as these help track progress and provide reassurance during unclear phases. Improving how I manage that discomfort will help me move forward more smoothly in future sprints.</p>
    
    
    <h3>What actions can I take for the next sprint?</h3>
    <p>Next sprint, I plan to build on the solution idea that I came up with and move into ideation with more focus. I’ll continue analysing competitors and case studies to support my direction and strengthen my concept. I also aim to reflect more regularly during the sprint to avoid bottling up uncertainty. With a clearer vision now forming, I feel more equipped to take strategic action in the upcoming phases.</p>

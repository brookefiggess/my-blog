        <h2>Week 06:</h2>
    
        <h3>Daily stand-up questions:</h3>
    
        <p>1. What did I accomplish yesterday?</p>
        <p>2. What will I do today?</p>
        <p>3. Are there any blockers?</p>
    
        <br>
    
        <strong>Tuesday:</strong>
        <p>2. Ask for feedback and finalise hi-fi prototype</p>
        <p>3. Trying to get more of a comprehensive understanding of how might I implement the database requirement into my project</p>
    
        <strong>Wednesday:</strong>
        <p>1. Got feedback on how extensive the database needs to be and overlooked the content I needed to present</p>
        <p>2. Make final refinements of my first hi-fi prototype iteration</p>
        <p>3. No current blockers</p>
    
        <strong>Thursday:</strong>
        <p>1. Worked on my hi-fi which went well alongside fixing feedback </p>
        <p>2. Today I will be presenting my WIP</p>
        <p>3. No current blockers</p>
    
        <strong>Friday:</strong>
        <p>1. Presented WIP and got insightful feedback </p>
        <p>2. Included new feedback to hi-fi</p>
        <p>3. No current blockers</p>
    
        <br>


        <h3>What went well?</h3>
        <p>This week was productive for me. I successfully presented the first iteration of my hi-fi prototype. Receiving feedback throughout the week, (especially during my WIP presentation) helped me clarify the direction of my design and make necessary refinements. I also made steady progress without any blockers, which allowed me to maintain momentum across the week. Another highlight was getting a better understanding of how the database could integrate with my project, giving me more clarity on the technical side.</p>
    
        
        <h3>What didn't go well?</h3>
        <p>Early in the week, I underestimated the presentation component of my hi-fi, which meant I had to play catch-up to ensure everything was clearly communicated. While I began looking into how to implement a database, I didn’t dive as deep as I’d hoped on the visual side of things, so that area still feels a little uncertain. There’s also room to improve how I translate feedback into quick design iterations while balancing the technical requirements.</p>
    
        
        <h3>What can be improved?</h3>
        <p>Allocating set time blocks to technical development (not just design) will help ensure both sides of the project evolve together. I also want to become more intentional with how I document feedback and translate it into my iterations more efficiently.</p>
        
        
        <h3>What actions can I take for the next sprint?</h3>
        <p>Next sprint, I’ll prioritise clarifying the database requirements and begin actively implementing a basic structure for it. I’ll also work on refining my second hi-fi prototype based on the latest feedback. To prepare for the final presentation, I’ll allocate time earlier in the week for scripting and slide prep. Lastly, I’ll plan to conduct a quick round of user testing to validate whether the updated design changes are effective.</p>

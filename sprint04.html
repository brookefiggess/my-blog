        <strong>Wednesday:</strong>
        <p>1. User tested my first round of paper prototypes. </p>
        <p>2. Summarise findings of the interviews.</p>

        <p>2. Continue on with brand strategy doc - I aim to complete secondary research, target audience and personas today.</p>
        <p>3. Focusing too much on visual design over the content making the process take a lot longer. </p>
    
        <br>
    
        
    
        <h3>What went well?</h3>
        <p>As the work I was doing began to start taking a visual turn, it provided me with enough momentum to stay on track throughout the week. This sprint was all about recognising the users emotional needs and how we as a brand might translate that visually. I noticed a significant improvement in my paper prototype type stage from last term, meaning that my foundational design needed much less minor improvements as I implemented those off the first draft. Seeing past feedback I have taken on board make a positive change to my designs is gratifying.</p>
    
        
        <h3>What didn't go well?</h3>
        <p>Being so connected to my work from a visual standpoint this week partially overflowed into my brand strategy document. Though that is not necessarily a bad thing, it took away my focus towards the core content which was the most important part of this document. Being too occupied on visuals when starting off made the process significantly more time consuming than it had to be.</p>
    
        
        <h3>What can be improved?</h3>
        <p>Alike most designers, getting carried away with the visual parts is a common issue to be confronted with. Understanding what my project needs in that moment is something I need to consider when starting new phases of the project. The theory work my seem less satisfying to complete however it is the main purpose of most projects.</p>
        
        
        <h3>What actions can I take for the next sprint?</h3>
        <p>Next sprint, I will recenter my priorities and briefly reflect on what my short term goals are for each chunk of work I complete. Incorporating what needs to be done first before I get into how it looks is something I will do next time.</p>

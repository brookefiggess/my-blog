    <h3>What went well?</h3>
    <p>Reflecting on my feedback from the prior summative gave me goals to work towards for these upcoming interview sessions. I felt much more confident scheduling and constructing the interviews this time around. This made me feel accomplished and gave me a sense of motivation I needed to keep moving forward. I also managed to complete most tasks that were listed in my weekly sprint schedule which help reassure that I am where I intended to be in this point in time.</p>

    
    <h3>What didn't go well?</h3>
    <p>I should have thought about my interview pool more in depth before completing the interviews. The reason for his being is I do not believe I selected the right participants to question, my topic is rather niche and though it is common not everyone does it. I should Have considered to have an even split between BNPL users and non users so all findings are fair and adequate.</p>

    
    <h3>What can be improved?</h3>
    <p>While I felt more confident conducting interviews and staying on track with my sprint goals, one key area I would improve is my participant selection process. Upon reflection I realise I didn't think deeply enough about the variation within my interview pool. My topic of buy now pay later is somewhat niche. Though it affects many, not everyone uses it directly. As a result of this, the data I did collect leaned too much towards a certain perspective and limited the scope of my insight.</p>
    
    
    <h3>What actions can I take for the next sprint?</h3>
    <p>Moving forward, I would aim to include a more balanced mixed of BNPL users and non users. This would provide a broader, more objective understanding of the perceptions, behaviours and impacts associated with BNPL.
       In regards to the next sprint I will recenter my upcoming design approach around my new findings rather than trying to morph the BNPL aspect to somehow fit.</p>

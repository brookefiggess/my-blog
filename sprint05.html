        <h3>What went well?</h3>
        <p>This week started off strong. I spent time researching different brand identity styles and explored three clear visual directions through mood boards. This really helped me get a feel for the tone I wanted to set with my branding. I felt focused and creatively engaged, and having no blockers early in the week allowed me to make solid progress without much stress. Even though I didn’t fully complete my sprint goal due to some unexpected changes later on, I still managed to build a strong foundation with my visual research and early design decisions.</p>
    
        
        <h3>What didn't go well?</h3>
        <p>After presenting my pitch, I was told that my visual branding wasn’t strong enough and needed reworking. That feedback hit hard, especially because I thought I’d already locked in that part of the project. It was frustrating and a bit overwhelming knowing I had to go back and redo work I thought was finished. The main issue was not getting feedback earlier. If I had connected with a mentor sooner, I could’ve made smaller changes along the way instead of a major overhaul at the end of the week.</p>
    
        
        <h3>What can be improved?</h3>
        <p>One key thing I need to improve is how early I reach out for feedback. I didn’t book a mentoring session early enough, and as a result, I only got critical feedback on my brand identity during my extended proposal pitch. By then, I had assumed my branding was basically done—but I ended up needing to change a lot. That delay caused a bit of a setback and threw off my schedule. Next time, I’ll make sure to check in earlier, even if I think I’m on the right track.</p>
        
        
        <h3>What actions can I take for the next sprint?</h3>
        <p>Next sprint, I’m going to prioritise booking a mentoring session early on so I can catch any major issues before they snowball. My main focus will be on refining and applying the updated brand visuals based on the feedback I received. I also plan to build some buffer time into my schedule to allow space for unexpected changes, and I’ll make time at the end of the week to reflect and adjust as needed.</p>
